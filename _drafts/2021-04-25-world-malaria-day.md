	- at least some of the money spent on my salary is actually helping fight malaria

## 

I joined a lab doing malaria research as an undergraduate in 2013 and have stayed in the field ever since. At the time, my reasoning for choosing to study the malaria parasite (as opposed to a lab doing research on e.g., cancer or neurodegenerative diseases) was that malaria affected mostly young people in the developing world. I had a naive sense that just by joining the field, I would be "helping" in some way. I was working (and still do) on an esoteric topic relating to the basic biology of the malaria parasite. Pretty quickly I realised that I would be very unlikely to make a major discovery in my field and even if I did, there was an even smaller chance that my findings would go on to inform anything practical like drug or vaccine development. Yet for a long time, I fell into the bad habit of justifying my research on the basis of these minuscule possibilities:

 > This could provide an important new strategy to combat this lethal human pathogen.
 
This quote is the final sentence of one of my papers ((McHugh et al. 2015))[https://doi.org/10.1111/mmi.13201] and sums up this kind of disingenuous attitude. The topic of the paper was some cool biology - how the malaria parasite moves proteins around its host cell -  but now I find this sentence embarrassing. The paper topic was *interesting*, not "important", and the idea that it could help in combating malaria is so implausible that I would now consider it in poor taste to suggest it.

I should say that I think basic research is a valuable pursuit in its own right. We should study all kinds of biological phenomena even if only for pure interest, and to increase human knowledge. We have seen time and again that knowledge arising from basic research can have unforeseen importance and impact and for these reasons it should be funded at higher levels than it is today. It is a real privilege to work in academia and I love to do it. But I became unsure about my rationale for working on the malaria parasite, and not for example, a non-pathogenic organism. Underlying this was a feeling that the money funding malaria research, especially the type of academic research that I do, was so unlikely to help drive malaria case numbers or deaths down. However, if that same money was spent on the most cost-effective ways to prevent malaria it would save lives. The classic academic refrain, "But we might discover something helpful!" just didn't ring true, particularly when malaria can be and has been eliminated from countries using known interventions. <links>
