## About me

I'm a Research Fellow at the University of Melbourne in the [Ralph Laboratory](https://www.bio21.unimelb.edu.au/ralph-group). I'm interested in the malaria parasite *Plasmodium falciparum* and how mRNA is modified and processed in this organism. To study this, I make transgenic parasites with CRISPR, then use RNA sequencing and bioinformatics approaches to answer questions about parasite RNA biology. 

I completed my PhD at the University of Melbourne and wrote my [thesis](https://emchugh.io/files/2018-02-25-thesis.pdf) on organelles deployed by the malaria parasite into the host cell.
